# FormattableTables
Making tables using the formattable package in R

The scripts associated with this project will help you download, manipulate, and format data from AIMS in a way that you can make tables that are informative and look appealing. 

Before beginning this tutorial it is important to have: 
1. [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) downloaded 
3. Possess an [AIMS API Key](https://open-aims.github.io/data-platform/key-request) 
4. [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

The last two are the most important, but hopefully we can quickly review how to set up RStudio with GitHub (through) Git, for anyone that needs to. This will make it easier in the future as you can directly upload your scripts to GitHub as you work. Instead, of moving it all to GitHub once you are done. Keeping your code on GitHub is also a way to backup your scripts, as GitHub can also work as a cloud storage system for your work.
